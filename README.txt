Made by Laurent Henri Plassart, 2153058
of ESE-1D-e for Microcontrollers 1
as an Assignments/Projects.

Here you can see basic implementations of 
different electronic compoments such as
sensors, display, potentiometer, etc.

Week 1: Basics
  Introduces the Arduino environment.
  Assignment: Create an LED chaser using six LEDs, turning each on in sequence with a 100ms interval.
Week 2: Digital
  Focuses on using switches as inputs and controlling LEDs without delay().
  Assignment: Extend the LED chaser to include speed control and direction changes using switches.
Week 3: Analog
  Introduces analog input/output with sensors like potentiometers and photoresistors.
  Assignment: Use two sensors to trigger an alarm (rapid LED blinking), deactivated by a switch.
Week 4: Communication
  Covers serial communication for user input and feedback.
  Assignment: Implement a code lock using serial input with three attempts and a lockout mechanism.
Week 5: Control Structures
  Explores program flow control (loops, if statements, switch-case).
  Assignment: Modify the LED chaser to use a potentiometer for speed control and serial input for direction.
Week 6: Sensors and Actuators
  Focuses on interfacing with sensors and displaying data on an LCD.
  Assignment: Use an ultrasonic rangefinder to measure distance and display it on an LCD, with LED alerts for out-of-range values.
